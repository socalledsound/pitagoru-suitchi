# pitagoru suitchi

materials for a new course that introduces javascript using the notion of a pythagorean switch, culminating in an online multiplayer version where the marble goes through everyone's screen in real time....

should it be strictly webGL??

maybe even do it for this last unit??

(maybe i should do it in python with blender instead???!!?)
